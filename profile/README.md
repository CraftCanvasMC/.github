## Features & Highlights

### Rewritten Scheduler
- Canvas is primarily based on a rewritten scheduler for Folia, which makes Canvas extremely fast in comparison to other forks.

### Optimized Chunk Generation
- With fixed linear scaling through a complete rewrite of the chunk system executor, Canvas achieves **unparalleled chunk performance** compared to other forks.

### Extensive Configuration
- Fine-tune aspects of your server with fully documented configuration options and performance settings.

### Proper Region Profiling
- Canvas introduces a genuine Spark profiler that is fully compatible with region threading, replacing the limited Folia profiling engine.

### Powerful and Optimized
- By fixing **numerous** Folia bugs and crashes, Canvas delivers a high-performance, stable, and reliable experience.

## Getting Started

### Downloading & Running

1. Download the latest server JAR from the **Downloads** page on [canvasmc.io](https://canvasmc.io/downloads).  
2. Launch using Java (Java 21+ required) with your preferred arguments and configuration.

### Building from Source

**Requirements:**

- Java 21
- Git (configured with name/email)

**Common build commands:**

```bash
./gradlew applyAllPatches
./gradlew buildMojmapPublisherJar
./gradlew runDevServer
```

There is also a helper script:

```bash
./rebuildPatches
```

which regenerates patches for modified directories.

## Using the Canvas API in Plugins

You can use Canvas’s API in your own Minecraft plugins. Here’s an example of how to include it in your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
repositories {
  maven {
    name = "Canvas"
    url = uri("https://maven.canvasmc.io/snapshots")
  }
  mavenCentral()
  maven("https://repo.papermc.io/repository/maven-public/")
}
dependencies {
  implementation("io.canvasmc.canvas:canvas-api:1.21.8-R0.1-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

Replace the version number with the appropriate version you want to target.

* Canvas is a fork of **Folia** and is *not* a drop-in replacement for Purpur, Paper, or other non-Folia forks. It is intended primarily for environments already using Folia or Folia-based forks.
* The project adheres strictly to Folia’s threading and safety rules and does *not* permit bypassing them.
